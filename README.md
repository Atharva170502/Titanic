This repository contains code and resources for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition hosted on Kaggle. 
The goal of the competition is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were likely to survive?" using passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).
Various models were compared and tested for the accuracy of the models. Our final model achieved an accuracy of 75.84% on the test dataset.
